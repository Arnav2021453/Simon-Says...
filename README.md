The game gives a tile to be clicked at each new level in addition to the previously given pattern of tiles. The user has to tap the tiles in correct order from the start at each new level. On each level correct sequence of taps enables the user to advance to a higher level. Otherwise a wrong tap will end up in the game being over. The game is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website updates and displays the user's best score and current score in real-time as the game progresses.
